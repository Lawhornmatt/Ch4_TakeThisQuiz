## WELCOME:
This is the README.md for the Challenge Four "Quiz API" for the UT Coding Bootcamp.

This is a from-scratch website that lets you take a timed quiz.


I plan on the following options:

* I want to implement a modular design, utilizing object-orientated structure, that loads in and "builds" the quiz
* Have a base "quiz" object that loads a "main screen" quiz by default with a single page and hidden timer. Each "answer" will instead be a different quiz in storage that can be loaded in.
